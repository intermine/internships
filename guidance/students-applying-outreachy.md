title: Advice for students applying to InterMine through Outreachy
---

Outreachy differs from GSoC in many aspects. Unlike GSoC, Outreachy participants can contribute in design work, documentation, community management, marketing, etc. Also, Outreachy applicants don't have to be students, and could be graduates, people returning to work after a break, or perhaps something else.

## Submit your initial application

The initial application includes your basic details as well as some additional information and essays. You have to answer these four essay questions -

1. Does your learning environment have few people who share your identity or background? Please provide details.
2. What systemic bias or discrimination have you faced while building your skills?
3. What systemic bias or discrimination would you face if you applied for a job in the technology industry of your country?
4. What barriers or concerns have kept you from contributing to free and open source software?

We encourage you to write your personal stories and past experiences. We want you to know that we won't judge your grammar, writing style or spelling. Please provide examples and statistics wherever you can.

All accepted applicants of this process are eligible for the Contributing period.

## Select a project and Contribute

Browse our [project ideas list](../../project-ideas/2019/). If you're interested in a specific project, read the project description in detail and there should be a "Get started" section that will let you know what to do next. Please feel free to pop onto the #Outreachy channel on our [chat server](http://chat.intermine.org) if you get stuck or have questions.

Please note that you are required to make atleast one contribution to be eligible to be selected as an intern. Applicants are also required to [record contributions](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#record-contributions) on the outreachy website. When in doubt, ask the project mentor! It's good to always ask for suggestions.

## Getting started

- Take the [FlyMine](https://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tutorial or watch some helpful [videos](http://intermine.org/tutorials/). InterMine has lots of mines (see the [registry](http://registry.intermine.org/)), FlyMine is an InterMine instance loaded with fruit fly data. This is how people access data in an InterMine using the web browser.
- Take the [Python](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/) or [Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Webservice-InterMine/lib/Webservice/InterMine/Cookbook.pod) InterMine tutorials. InterMine has [client libraries](https://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/) in Python, Perl, JavaScript, R and Java. This is how people access data in an InterMine using the command line. We also have an early [JavaScript tutorial](https://hackmd.io/QvITbTCSQkKWYjE2i_Xj_w#) under development. 

Now you have a pretty good idea of how people use InterMine to search genomic data!

## Apply!

Please note that only applicants that record a contribution to a project will be able to submit a final application through the Outreachy website. The final application asks questions about past experience, relevant projects, proposed timeline for outreachy project. 

## Application Guidelines

We expect to receive, as we did last year, lots of high quality applications. So please do give your application some thought!

* A clear understanding of the problem we need solved.
* A clear plan of action. What are you going to actually do?
* Milestones should be achievable and realistic.
* Things happen! We can’t foresee every problem! We are happy to see applications that say “I will do A and B. If there is time, I will do C.”
* Although the Outreachy application is different from GSoC, you can read the proposal from one of our [successful 2018 GSoC applicants](https://github.com/nupurgunwant/GSoC-Proposal), this will help you in writing your final application. 

<!-- We are happy to read your application and give you feedback. Please allow for a few days for us to get back to you -- don’t wait until the last minute! Can we do this in Outreachy? -->
