title: Guidance for Mentors
---

Please see the [Guidance for accepted students](students-accepted.md) for general student expectations. Mentors based onsite at Cambridge will provide weekly updates at the team meeting.

Also read (or at least skim!) the [Google Manual](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) for mentors. It's actually very useful.

Finally, we have the [GSoC Mentor Terms and Conditions](mentor-terms-and-conditions.md), where we try to set out openly what both what we expect from mentors and how we spend the money Google pays InterMine. We've done our best to be clear and correct, but things may change. Please be aware the terms and conditions are _not_ a contract.
