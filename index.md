Welcome to the InterMine GSoC 2018 homepage!

## Students

We're excited that you're interested in GSoC with InterMine! Feel free to browse our [project ideas list](project-ideas/2018/). If you're interested in a project, please email _both_ mentors listed for the project. We'll be happy to discuss the projects in more detail. 

If you'd like to start contributing to InterMine, you're welcome to do this anytime, not just GSoC! Check out these locations:

- Issues labelled [good first bug](https://github.com/intermine/intermine/labels/good%20first%20bug) in InterMine - some of these don't require any coding so can be easy to get started.
- Any of the issues in these two repos: (Linux / Mac users only). [bsbang-crawler](https://github.com/justinccdev/bsbang-crawler/issues/7) and [bsbang-frontend](https://github.com/justinccdev/bsbang-frontend/issues).
- [Help Wanted](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/labels/Help%20Wanted) in BlueGenes, our ClojureScript-based UI.
- finally, if none of those suit you - have a look at any repository that interests you and see if you can think of an improvement on your own! 

You can read more about how Google Summer of Code went last year with InterMine in [our blog](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/tag/gsoc-2017/).
